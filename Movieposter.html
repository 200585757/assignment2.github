        <p align="justify">Manasa Samyuktha (Keerthy Suresh), a woman with big goals from a middle-class family, moves to the US after her brother Arjun (Kamal Kamaraju) got a job. She dreams of starting up her own tea business as promised to her grandfather (Rajendra Prasad) to continue his legacy but her family does not agree due to financial problems. On the way to becoming a successful businesswoman, she is forced to deal with sexism, criticism, and rivalry with Kailash Sivakumar (KSK) (Jagapathi Babu). KSK is a dangerous rival coffee manufacturer who tries to put her down, saying that a woman can never be successful, especially in business. Manasa decides to beat him and show him that a woman can be anything she aspires to be. The story revolves around her journey and the problems she faces while she attempts to start up her business. This character inspire many middle class girls to dream big and achieve it.</p>
